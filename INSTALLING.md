# DLT core dependency
Until published in `pypi` the preferred method is to clone `rasa_data_ingestion` and then add it as editable module. You can just type:
```
make dev
```
which will update dependencies and add the editable module (provided you cloned it before)

Do not forget to enter to use `poetry shell` to enter development environment before running examples.
