Advanced:
There are stream resources that contain many data types ie. RASA Tracker so a single resource may map to many tables:
1. hints can also be functions and lambdas to create dynamic hints based on data items yielded
2. I will re-introduce the `with_table` modifier function from v1 - it is less efficient but more intuitive for the user
