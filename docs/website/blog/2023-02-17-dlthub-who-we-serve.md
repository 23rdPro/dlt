The number of Python developers increased from [7 million in 2017](https://adtmag.com/articles/2018/09/24/developer-economics-survey.aspx) to 
[15.7 million in Q1 2021](https://slashdata-website-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/sample_reports/VZtJWxZw5Q9NDSAQ.pdf) and grew by 
[3 million (20%) between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 alone](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), making it the 
[most popular programming language in Q3 2022](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022). A large percentage of this new group are 
what we call “Python practitioners”—[data folks and scripters](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/#PurposesUsingPython). 
This group uses Python to do tasks for their jobs, but they do not consider themselves software engineers.

They are entering modern organizations in masse. Organizations often 
[employ them for data-related jobs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022),  especially in data engineering, data science, analytics 
and ML. They must work with established data sources, data stores, and data pipelines that are essential to the business of these organisations.

These organisations, though, are not providing them with the type of tooling they learnt to expect. There’s no “Jupyter notebook, Pandas, 
Numpy for data loading” that is awaiting them. 

At this stage of dlt we are focused on serving the needs of organisations with 150 employees or less. Companies of this size typically have their 
first data hires. They want data to be at their core: their CEOs may want to make their companies more “data driven” and “user centric”. 
Their CTOs may want to “build a data warehouse for automation and self service”. They are frequently eager to take advantage of the skills of 
Python practioners that they hired.

To make our mission to make the next generation of Python users autonomous in these organisations a reality we believe we need to build dlt in a 
“Pythonic” way. Anyone that can write a loop in Python script should be able to write a source and load it. There should zero learning curve. 
Anyone in these organisations that gets basic Python should be able to use dlt right away.

For our mission to come to fruition we also build dlt to be loved not only by Python users but also data engineers. This is crucial because eventually 
these folks will be brought in to help with data loading in an organization. We need data engineers to evolve dlt pipelines rather than ripping them 
out and replacing them like they almost always do to scripts written by Python practitioners today. They should be able do so with zero learning curve 
as they won’t need to learn a new framework. For example, writing a new source with a loading pipeline with dlt should be a joyful and simple experience 
for any dlt beginner. To develop with dlt a anyone should install it as any other Python library - ‘pip install pydlt’ - and be ready to go. Our 
approach yields many more advantages for them. Already today data engineers love the automatic schema inference & evolution as well as the 
customizability of dlt.
