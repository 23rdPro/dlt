:::info
**TL;DR: As of last week, there is a dlt pipeline that loads data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4). We‚Äôve been excited about GA4 for a while now, so we decided to build some internal dashboards and show you how we did it.**
:::

### Why GA4?

We set out to build an internal dashboard demo based on data from Google Analytics (GA4). Google announced that they will stop processing hits for Universal Analytics (UA) on July 1st, 2023, so many people are now having to figure out how to set up analytics on top of GA4 instead of UA and struggling to do so. For example, in UA, a session represents the period of time that a user is actively engaged on your site, while in GA4, a `session_start` event generates a session ID that is associated with all future events during the session. Our hope is that this demo helps you begin this transition!

### Initial explorations

We decided to make a dashboard that helps us better understand data attribution for our blog posts (e.g. [As DuckDB crosses 1M downloads / month, what do its users do?](./2023-03-09-duckdb-1M-downloads-users.mdx)). Once we got our [credentials](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials) working, we then used the GA4 `dlt` pipeline to load data into a DuckDB instance on our laptop. This allowed us to figure out what requests we needed to make to get the necessary data to show the impact of each blog post (e.g. across different channels, what was the subsequent engagement with our docs, etc). We founded it helpful to use [GA4 Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.google/ga4/query-explorer/) for this.

### Internal dashboard

Once we figured out what we wanted to include in the dashboard, then we continued to work locally and built the internal dashboard using Streamlit above. You can run it on your laptop by cloning [the repo](https://github.com/dlt-hub/ga4-internal-dashboard-demo), and the following the steps listed [here](https://github.com/dlt-hub/ga4-internal-dashboard-demo/tree/main/internal-dashboards).

### Deploying the data warehouse

Once it was ready, we decided to store the data in a Postgres database on the same Google Cloud VM instance where we planned to deploy the streamlit app. We did this by following [these steps](https://github.com/dlt-hub/README.md).

### Deploying the `dlt` pipeline with GitHub Actions

 We then followed the [deploy a pipeline](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/deploy-a-pipeline) walkthrough to load the data daily with GitHub Actions.

### Deploying the dashboard

Finally, we deployed the Streamlit app on a [Google Cloud VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute), following [these steps](https://github.com/dlt-hub/ga4-internal-dashboard-demo).
