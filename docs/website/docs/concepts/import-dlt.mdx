# Import `dlt`

To use `dlt` functions, please import the `dlt` library:
```python
import dlt
```

In the `dlt` module you can:
1. Define and run [pipelines](pipeline.md) with `dlt.pipeline`
2. Declare [sources](source.md) and [resources](resource.md) using `@dlt.source` and `@dlt.resource` decorators
3. Define and access [configuration](../customization/configuration.md) values and [credentials](../customization/credentials.md) with `dlt.config` and `dlt.secrets`
4. Access the current pipeline [state](state.md) using `dlt.current.state` in your sources and resources as well as the current schema and pipeline
