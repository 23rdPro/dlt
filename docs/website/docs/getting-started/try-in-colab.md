# What is the simplest way to try dlt?

Our [colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NfSB1DpwbbHX9_t5vlalBTf13utwpMGx?usp=sharing) allows you to see how the pipeline works - It takes some data, and outputs structure tables in db.

The [schema evolution demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H6HKFi-U1V4p0afVucw_Jzv1oiFbH2bu#scrollTo=e4y4sQ78P_OM) presents a similar situation - you can see how new columns and multi-type columns are handled. If you have a slack webhook set, you get a notification too.

# The demo is trivial, what else is there?
The demo is meant as a quick starting point - the next steps could be
* check out the comprehensive [build a pipeline](./getting-started/build-a-data-pipeline.md) doc to better understand what you can do with dlt
* check out the build a data platform section to see how to build a data warehouse or lake with dlt
* check out the existing pipelines - you can use them for your ingestion, or as reference examples for what you want to build.
